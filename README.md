# **Movie Analysis Project**

## **Project Overview**

This project is a comprehensive analysis of movie data using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). The goal of the project is to extract, manipulate, and analyze data to gain insights into various aspects of the movie industry, such as genres, ratings, revenue, and release dates. 

## **Objectives**

1. **Data Extraction and Cleaning**: Importing raw movie data into SQL Server and performing data cleaning operations to ensure data quality and consistency.
2. **Data Transformation**: Using SQL queries to transform and organize the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducting exploratory analysis to understand the distribution of data and identify trends and patterns.
4. **Insights and Visualization**: Generating insights from the data and visualizing them using SQL queries and built-in SSMS tools.

## **Key Features**

- **Data Import and Setup**: Scripts to import and set up the movie database
