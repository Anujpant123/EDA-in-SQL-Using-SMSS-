# Airplane Crash Data Analysis (1908- 2009)

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of airplane crash data from 1908 to 2009. The data includes various details such as the date, location, operator, aircraft type, fatalities, and more. The analysis is performed using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to explore trends, identify patterns, and generate insights into aviation safety over the last century.

## Tools and Technologies
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): Used for querying, analyzing, and visualizing the dataset.
SQL: For data retrieval, manipulation, and analysis.


## Analysis
**1. Trend Analysis**
Yearly Crash Trends: A query was created to analyze the number of crashes per year and visualize trends over time.
Monthly and Daily Trends: Further analysis was conducted to identify seasonal or daily patterns in crash occurrences.

**2. Geographical Analysis**
Top Locations: Identified locations with the highest number of crashes.
Country-wise Distribution: A breakdown of crashes by country to understand regional patterns.

**3. Operator Analysis**
Top Operators: Analyzed which airlines or operators had the most crashes and explored the potential reasons behind them.

**4. Fatality Analysis**
Fatality Rate Over Time: Analyzed the fatality rate over the years to assess improvements in aviation safety.
Survival Analysis: Explored factors contributing to survival in crashes.

**5. Cause Analysis**
Categorization of Causes: Grouped the causes of crashes into categories and analyzed the frequency of each category.


## Results and Insights
Historical Trends: There was a significant increase in crashes during certain periods, likely corresponding to increased air travel.
Geographical Insights: Certain regions showed higher crash frequencies, possibly due to higher air traffic or other factors.
Operator Safety: Some operators had disproportionately high crash rates, which could warrant further investigation.
Improved Safety: The fatality rate showed a downward trend over time, indicating improvements in aviation safety and technology.
Common Causes: Human error and mechanical failures were identified as the most common causes of crashes.

## Conclusion
This analysis provided valuable insights into airplane crashes from 1908 to 2009. By exploring trends, geographical patterns, operator safety records, and causes of crashes, we gained a deeper understanding of aviation safety and the factors influencing crash outcomes. The results can be used to inform safety improvements and future research in the field of aviation.

## Future Work
Expanding the Dataset: Incorporating data beyond 2009 to continue the analysis and observe more recent trends.
Advanced Analysis: Utilizing machine learning techniques to predict potential risk factors for airplane crashes.
